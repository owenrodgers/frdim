Two levels of frdim implementation:

today:
write a high and low level implementation of frdim
make sure everything is uniform and documented

High Level:
*** SDL2 implementation is under the hood ***
Showcase mathematical concepts without access to the rendering loop of the proces


ie:

fn main() {
    my hyper_sphere = new hyperspherere()
    change variables

    call something similar to:
    render(hyper_sphere)
}



Low Leve:
User has access to rendering loop and keyboard input
Use frdim as a math library
